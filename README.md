## Hey! I am Shubh üëãüèΩ,

This project was created for the task round submission of Algozenith. The project contains a CMS based UI Design that needed to be developed from scratch and deployed. 

### This project is : 
1. Created with no component libraries. 
2. Has easter egg animations for a better user interaction
3. Uses animation library like GSAP to introduce smooth transformations
4. Coded in `React` and Deployed on `Vercel`.

Even though, I have tried to make the codebase as efficient and as easy to understand, this is a `visual representation` of the **file structure** :

### Code Efficiency :

`Example 1` <br />

`Example 2` <br />

<br />
<br />
I have tried to make the code as `clean` as possible in most places. I have added objects at the top of the code so that any changes in the UI can be done directly by less effort.

I have also made an array of objects to have all the data for the UI. Later, this data can be fetched from the database through the used props.
